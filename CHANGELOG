RODOS 2.19 - Last known SOUND_RELEASE
RODOS 2.20 - Patched versions
- Fixed a bug where |zap,12,"samplecommand" would not work as documented.
  This was being overwritten by relocated code.
  Moved the command buffer from 0xbec0 to 0xbf20
  Bonus for this is that the possible command length has changed from 31 (in V2.13) to 100 now.
