RODOS v2.19 KNOWN BUGS
----------------------
There are a few bugs I've discovered working through the code.

|OPT,10 and |OPT,11
    The manual documents these as:
        10.n - head load delay in ms. (default=1)
        11,n - head unload delay in ms. (default=1)

    These options should update these locations:
        Head load delay is at &be48
        Head unload delay is at &be4b

    In v2.19 |OPT,10 actually doesn't do anything. In fact if you try to use it, you get a "Wrong Number of Parameters" error.
    |OPT,11 is supposed to update &be4b but the code actually uses &be48. &be4b is never referenced, ever, except for ROM initialision
    but that just sets it to the default.

    This has been broken in different ways for several versions. v2.13 broke |OPT,10 by loading the value correctly, but calling a function that
    immediately overwrote that value.

|ZAP,|ROMS
    The start up string functionality as documented in:
        |ZAP,rom_number,...,"startup" and |ROMS, rom_number [,rom_number]...,"start up string"
    doesn't actually work.

    There is a buffer collision with the area where the "start up string" is held, so the string is corrupt on start up.
