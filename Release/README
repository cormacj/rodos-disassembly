About this release
------------------
This is NOT an official version of RODOS. This is a patch and update to RODOS V2.19.
I'm not affiliated with Romantic Robot and I've never worked with them. I just really like RODOS.

Background
----------
There was a bug introduced in V2.15 that corrupted a feature of the |ZAP and |ROMS commands.
I reported this to Romantic Robot way back in the day but it was never fixed. I use this feature for
development purposes, and the only work around was to generate a DISC file that would auto run on boot
but it's annoying.

How?
----
I had time, and I became curious about the nature of the bug, so I disassembled the ROM and looked into what
was going on. I discovered that there were memory location conflicts with some code that was relocated to allow
RODOS to interact with other ROMS while preserving its own state.
I've updated these buffer locations to lower the chances of conflict and overwrites.

Future
------
The ROM still has some buffer overflow issues, and have these existed since V2.13 at least.
I'm not planning on putting a lot of time into this, but I could fix them. If there are bugs or features you
would like, open an issue on github at https://github.com/cormacj/rodos-disassembly/issues and if it seems
possible and I have time I'll work on it.
The amount of space left in this rom is fairly limited. There's still an issue with the disassembly not being
fully complete, so the code fails if current memory locations shift.

TL;DR bugs can be fixed, but new features are hard.
