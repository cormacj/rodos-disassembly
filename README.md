# rodos-disassembly
This is a work in progress disassembly of RODOS v2.19.

Tools needed:
linux: z80asm and z80dasm

As of now this does compile to a binary exact copy of the official V2.19 rom.

#TODO
* More documentation
* Determining what more the various calls actually do.
* Determine where the |zap,ROMNUMBER,"Message/Command" buffer overflow is happening.
